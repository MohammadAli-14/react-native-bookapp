//CRON JOB EXPLANATION
//CRON jobs are scheduled tasks that run at specific intervals. 
// They are often used for tasks like sending emails, cleaning up databases, or performing regular 
// maintenance. In this case, we are using a cron job to check for expired tokens in the database
//  and delete them.
//We want to send 1 get request every 14 minutes to the server to check if there are any expired tokens 
// in the database.

//How to define a schedule
//You define a schedule using a cron expression, which consists of five fields representing

//!Minute, hour, day of month, month, and day of week.
